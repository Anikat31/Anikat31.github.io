# Hello — I’m **Anikat Kankaria**

I am a researcher at Internation Center for Theoritical Sciences- TIFR, Bengaluru. I am currently working working with [Samriddhi Sankar Ray](https://www.icts.res.in/people/samriddhi-sankar-ray).
My interest lies in far from equillibrium phenomenas namely, turbulence. Futher I am interested in dynamical-systems and other aspects of non-equillibrium physics like, ecology-evolution, networks, modeling and understanding the stochastic nature of financial markets, random-walks, mathematical aspects of turbulence.
